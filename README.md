<b>JavaScript Take 2</b>

So, a few months ago I lost my spark for JavaScript . I just felt too stupid to continue. I wasn't understanding anything about Objects (kind of important in an Object Oriented Language) and the DOM just gave me a headache. I also started back at work full time after maternity leave and have two little boys to take care of.

A few days ago I realised I was back to wasting my nights doing absolutely nothing. I missed coding. I missed creating random things. I missed the excitement when I got something right without any help. I didn't miss the frustration haha.

I'm now back on R1D4 of #100DaysOfCode and i'm enjoying every minute of it. Objects seem so much clearer now and the DOM isn't so intimidating. I feel excited to get into my coding every night and I daydream about the day I can say i've landed my first Dev role. 

So onto today's progress -

<b>R1D6 11th June 2019 - Colt Steele - Colour Game Refactoring.</b>

I don't really know what I was doing when I was refactoring. There was a lot going on on the page and I was honestly pretty lost! I might try to look into refactoring challenges and see if those are a thing! 

Today I spent a lot of time doing challeneges on SoloLearn and also completing a bit more of their JavaScript course to reinforce things I've already learned. I also dabbled in some Blue Prism DPA tutorials to begin trying to automate things at work, which is pretty exciting!

Tomorrow's goal - More JavaScript. The next section is jQuery on Colt's course, but I think I'll go to the "Tricky JS" section first. I've dabbled in jQuery before, but nothing major.

<b>R1D5 10th June 2019 - Colt Steele - DOM Manipulation.</b>

Spent tonight working on the Colour Game from Colt Steele's course. I kept stopping the video to do things and try them out for myself before Colt gave me the solution and I got it right 80% of the time. Event Listeners feel a lot more familiar to me now. I'm not finding myself completely lost. 

I do find that I am easily thrown off by a lot of lines of code - I find it hard to keep track of where i've been and what I'm doing, but that will all come in time, I guess! 

Tomorrow is for refactoring my Colour Game. Then the next section is jQuery which I have already done previously - but it'll be a good refresher. My goal for the end of this week is to complete the jQuery course, read "You Don't Know JS: Types and Grammar" to work on my vanilla JS knowledge.

<b>R1D4 9th June 2019 - Colt Steele - DOM Manipulation.</b>

Breezed through the basic section (and tested things out for myself before Colt gave any solutions) and began working on the projects in the Advanced Section. My Scorekeeper app is mostly complete, but while I was refactoring my scorekeeping functions I've made something go a little bit haywire and it won't go past 1 for each player. So I'll fix that tomorrow and then move on.
