<b>JavaScript Take 2</b>

So, a few months ago I lost my spark for JavaScript . I just felt too stupid to continue. I wasn't understanding anything about Objects (kind of important in an Object Oriented Language) and the DOM just gave me a headache. I also started back at work full time after maternity leave and have two little boys to take care of.

A few days ago I realised I was back to wasting my nights doing absolutely nothing. I missed coding. I missed creating random things. I missed the excitement when I got something right without any help. I didn't miss the frustration haha.

I'm now back on R1D4 of #100DaysOfCode and i'm enjoying every minute of it. Objects seem so much clearer now and the DOM isn't so intimidating. I feel excited to get into my coding every night and I daydream about the day I can say i've landed my first Dev role. 

So onto today's progress - 

<b>R1D4 - Colt Steele - DOM Manipulation.</b>

Breezed through the basic section (and tested things out for myself before Colt gave any solutions) and began working on the projects in the Advanced Section. My Scorekeeper app is mostly complete, but while I was refactoring my scorekeeping functions I've made something go a little bit haywire and it won't go past 1 for each player. So I'll fix that tomorrow and then move on.
